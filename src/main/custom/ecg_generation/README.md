1. Chunked Morphological Blending
When you generate a single ECG snippet for each “block” (i.e., a contiguous group of rows from the same state), you might want a smooth (gradual) or sharp (instant) transition from the old block’s wave shape to the new block’s wave shape.

In the code, we split each block into smaller time chunks (e.g., in generate_ecg_for_block(), chunk_size = 5.0 seconds).
For each sub-chunk, we blend from the old parameters (old_params) to the new parameters (new_params) using an alpha in [0..1], computed by a logistic “S‐curve.”
How to Control It
Chunk Size (defaults to 5.0 seconds)
Reducing chunk_size → more sub-chunks → more steps of blending → a slower, more gradual morphological change.
Increasing chunk_size → fewer sub-chunks → a sharper or more abrupt transition.
S-Curve Steepness (steepness=5.0 by default)
Lower steepness (e.g., 2.0 or 3.0) → alpha transitions more gently, closer to a linear ramp.
Higher steepness (e.g., 8.0, 10.0) → alpha remains near 0 for longer and then quickly snaps to 1, giving a sharper transition.
If you wanted a purely linear blend, you could replace:

python
Copy
alpha_lin = chunk_i / float(n_chunks - 1)
alpha_s   = s_curve(alpha_lin, steepness=5.0)
with just:

python
Copy
alpha_s = alpha_lin  # linear
2. create_ecg_params_from_vitals(): State‐Based ECG Morphology
The function create_ecg_params_from_vitals() adjusts the morphological arrays (ti, ai, bi) and HR/noise from a block of vitals plus a state_label (Neutral, STEMI, etc.).

It is where you see lines such as:

python
Copy
if state_label == 1:  # "Cardiac Ischaemia"
    a_i_list[4] = -abs(a_i_list[4]) * 0.8
    ...
elif state_label == 11:  # "STEMI (crisis)"
    a_i_list[4] = abs(a_i_list[4]) * 1.2
    ...
Each state can shift angles, invert T waves, add ST elevation, reduce R wave amplitude, etc. If you want more or less morphological difference for a certain state (e.g., more T wave flattening in Sepsis), just tweak these lines.

3. apply_vitals_to_params(): Mapping from Vital Signs to Wave Shapes
Inside create_ecg_params_from_vitals(), you’ll see a block that could call:

python
Copy
a_i_list, b_i_list, t_i_list = apply_vitals_to_params(
    hr_avg, dbp_avg, sbp_avg, rr_avg, spo2_avg,
    p_out["ai"], p_out["bi"], p_out["ti"]
)
Right now, it’s commented out because it can introduce large or unpredictable variability in wave shapes. If you un‐comment it, the function will scale wave amplitudes & timings based on HR, BP, and oxygen saturation. Keep in mind that:

If you do also apply big changes from your state‐specific code (like T wave inversion for STEMI), you could get even bigger amplitudes.
You might want to reduce the scaling factors inside apply_vitals_to_params() if the results become too extreme.
4. The ECG Normalization (–0.4 mV to +1.2 mV)
Inside _ecg_simulate_ecgsyn(), there’s a step at the end (in the code block with zmin/zmax) that normalizes the final wave to the –0.4 mV to +1.2 mV range:

python
Copy
zmin = np.min(z)
zmax = np.max(z)
z = (z - zmin) * 1.6 / zrange - 0.4
This is a quick way to ensure the final wave sits in a typical 1.6 mV range. If you comment that out to keep the raw amplitude from your morphological arrays:

Then each state’s R wave amplitude (and T, P, etc.) must be carefully set in create_ecg_params_from_vitals() so that the final output makes sense (not, e.g., 0–10 mV).
You might want to scale them, e.g. by a_i_list[2] = 1.2 for the R wave at 1.2 mV, 0.3 for the T wave, etc.
5. How to Run the Script
If this is a standalone script named, e.g., generate_ecg_from_vitals.py, you can run it directly from a terminal:

bash
Copy
python generate_ecg_from_vitals.py
It reads in a “vitals.csv” file (which your main simulation might have produced). Then it writes an “ecg_data.csv” with time/amplitude pairs for each block.

If you want to integrate it into a larger data‐generation workflow, you can:

Ensure your “vitals.csv” is generated first by your Markov chain transitions or any other steps.

Import generate_ecg_postprocess or a similar function from the script in your pipeline, e.g.:

python
Copy
from generate_ecg_from_vitals import generate_ecg_postprocess

# Then call it after you create your vitals.csv
generate_ecg_postprocess(vitals_csv_path="vitals.csv", ecg_csv_name="ecg_data.csv")
Then your main script can proceed to do additional steps, or read in “ecg_data.csv” to combine with your final dataset.
